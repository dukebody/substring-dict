Substring Dict
==============

This is a na√Øve substring dict implemented in plain Python. Works with both Python 2 and 3.

The idea of a Substring Dict is taken from [Jeff Donner's one](https://github.com/JDonner/SuffixTree/blob/master/SuffixTree/SubstringDict.py).

Note however that Jeff's one is much more efficient since it uses a suffix tree, which is optimized for substring search. Please do your own benchmark testing!
